Yes, that's a very strong possibility and a common reason for this type of "not found" error when you're sure the model name should be correct.
The API key you are using might:
Be for a different Google Cloud Project: The API key is tied to a specific Google Cloud Project. If gemini-pro (or the Generative Language API) isn't enabled or available in that specific project, you'll get this error.
Not have the "Generative Language API" (or its equivalent name for Gemini) enabled: Even if the project is correct, the specific API service for Gemini models needs to be explicitly enabled within that project.
Be associated with a free tier or a specific program that doesn't include gemini-pro: Some initial access or free tiers might only grant access to certain models (e.g., older PaLM models, or perhaps a limited version of Gemini if that exists). gemini-pro is a powerful model and usually requires a properly configured project with billing enabled (even if you're within free tier usage limits, billing often needs to be set up).
Have restrictions applied to it: API keys can have restrictions on which APIs they can access.
Here's what you need to do to debug this:
Step 1: Verify Your Google Cloud Project and Enabled APIs
Identify the Project: Go to the Google Cloud Console. Make sure you have the correct project selected in the project dropdown at the top of the page. This should be the project for which you created the API key.
Check Enabled APIs:
In the navigation menu (hamburger icon â˜°), go to "APIs & Services" -> "Enabled APIs & services".
Look for an API named something like:
"Generative Language API" (this is a common one for Gemini)
"Vertex AI API" (if you intended to use Gemini through Vertex AI, which uses different client libraries and model naming conventions. Your current code uses the google-generativeai SDK which typically points to the direct Gemini API, not Vertex AI's Gemini endpoints.)
If you don't see the relevant API enabled, you'll need to enable it:
Click on "+ ENABLE APIS AND SERVICES" at the top.
Search for "Generative Language API" (or "Gemini").
Click on it and then click "Enable".
Check Billing:
In the navigation menu, go to "Billing".
Ensure that the project is linked to an active billing account. While there are free tiers for Gemini, a billing account often needs to be set up for the project.
Step 2: Verify Your API Key's Restrictions (If Any)
Go to "APIs & Services" -> "Credentials".
Find the API key you are using.
Click on the key name to see its details.
Check the "API restrictions" section. If it's restricted, make sure it's allowed to access the "Generative Language API" (or whatever the correct API name is that you found enabled). It's often simpler to start with "Don't restrict key" for debugging, and then add restrictions later once it's working.
Step 3: Run list_models() Again After Verifying Project and API
Once you've confirmed the project is correct, the API is enabled, and billing is set up:
import google.generativeai as genai
import os

# Ensure your GEMINI_API_KEY environment variable is set to the key
# you just verified in the Google Cloud Console.
api_key = os.getenv('GEMINI_API_KEY')
if not api_key:
    raise ValueError("GEMINI_API_KEY environment variable not set.")

try:
    genai.configure(api_key=api_key)

    print("Attempting to list models...")
    found_gemini_pro = False
    for m in genai.list_models():
        print(f"- Name: {m.name}, Display Name: {m.display_name}, Supported Methods: {m.supported_generation_methods}")
        if 'generateContent' in m.supported_generation_methods and ('gemini-pro' in m.name or 'gemini-1.0-pro' in m.name):
            print(f"  ^^ Found a potential Gemini Pro model: {m.name}")
            found_gemini_pro = True
        if 'gemini-1.5-pro' in m.name: # Also check for 1.5 pro
            print(f"  ^^ Found a potential Gemini 1.5 Pro model: {m.name}")
            found_gemini_pro = True


    if not found_gemini_pro:
        print("\nWARNING: 'gemini-pro' or 'gemini-1.0-pro' or 'gemini-1.5-pro' with 'generateContent' not found in the list.")
        print("Please double-check your Google Cloud Project setup:")
        print("1. Is the 'Generative Language API' enabled in your project?")
        print("2. Is billing enabled for your project?")
        print("3. Does your API key have the necessary permissions?")

except Exception as e:
    print(f"An error occurred during configuration or listing models: {e}")
    import traceback
    traceback.print_exc()
Use code with caution.
Python
What to look for in the list_models() output:
You absolutely need to see a model that contains gemini-pro (e.g., models/gemini-pro, models/gemini-1.0-pro, models/gemini-1.0-pro-001, or even newer ones like models/gemini-1.5-pro-latest) AND has generateContent in its supported_generation_methods.
If models/gemini-pro isn't listed, but models/gemini-1.0-pro (or a similar variant) is, then use that exact name in your genai.GenerativeModel() call.
If list_models() still doesn't show gemini-pro or a suitable alternative after you've checked your Google Cloud project settings, then the issue is almost certainly with your project's access to that model via that API key. You might need to:
Ensure you're not in a region where gemini-pro isn't available through this specific API (though this is less common for widely available models).
Contact Google Cloud Support if you believe your project should have access.
The v1beta in the original error message might also indicate that the API endpoint your SDK is hitting (or the one your key is scoped to) is an older beta endpoint that no longer serves gemini-pro under that name or at all. Upgrading the google-generativeai library (as suggested before) helps ensure your SDK uses the latest stable endpoints. If you've already done that, then the project/key access is the prime suspect.
